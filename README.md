# Blockchain-SecTool-for-Document-Authenticity

## Project Overview

In current digital era, ensuring the authenticity of documents is crucial for various industries and sectors, including finance, legal, healthcare, and education. However, ensuring the credibility of these documents can be challenging, as they can be easily altered or manipulated, leading to
fraudulent activities, legal disputes, or data breaches.

Traditional methods of document verification often rely on centralized authorities or intermediaries, which may not always be reliable or transparent. Moreover, these methods can be time-consuming and costly, especially when dealing with a large volume of documents.

In addressing the challenges associated with verifying document authenticity, a security tool can be
developed to help with confirming the authenticity of the public shared documents. The Security tool is designed to validate and safeguard document authenticity in a digitally connected world. It uses blockchain technology to create an immutable timestamp, providing proof of a document's origin and integrity, ensuring trustworthiness, authenticity and integrity in the age of information exchange. This not only adds a layer of trust to the exchanged information but also sets a new
standard for document validation in the digital landscape.

## Problem Statement

Traditional ways of validating the authenticity of public shared documents have different weaknesses as documents traverse organizational boundaries and become public domain, ensuring
their authenticity becomes a pressing concern. Current verification methods often fall short, lacking the capability to provide an indisputable proof of a document's authenticity. Instances of
unauthorized alterations, misinformation, and document forgery pose significant threats to the
credibility of organizations and the information they disseminate. In this context, there is a critical need for a comprehensive security tool that can systematically and reliably verify document
authenticity, particularly when shared with the public, fostering a climate of trust and transparency in the digital exchange of information.

## Project significance

This project aims to enhance document authenticity, build trust in information sharing, mitigate tampering and forgery, reduce disputes and litigation risks, and comply with regulatory requirements.

## Project scope

The scope of this project aims to develop a security tool for verifying document authenticity using blockchain timestamping, incorporating features like authentication mechanism and blockchain integration. However, it will not involve creation of an entire blockchain infrastructure outside the specified document verification process.
